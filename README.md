# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to help quantify the benefits of using Amazon's Vine Program for sellers on the website. The program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.


### Results 

Analyzing data from video games sold on Amazon there is only a small sample size of products that used the Vine program. But from that sample size we can look and see that the Vine program does in fact lead to a greater percentage of 5-star reviews for sellers.

The total number of reviews that used the Vine program was only 90 in total.

The total number of reviews without the Vine program was 37,831

Filtering the data to only provide us with a dataset that contains helpful votes and then drilling down further to seeing which of these reviews used the Vine program we see that 48.9% of them received helpful 5 star reviews. 

The total number of 5-star reviews for the Vine program was 44 with the total number of 4-star reviews without it was 14,704.

Almost 50%! 

For the products that did not use the Vine program they had a much lower percentage of 5-star ratings.

Coming in at 38.9%, a full 10 percentage points less than those that used the program. 

## Summary 

Overall with the small sample size I would say there is a positive trend in using the Vine program. Providing almost half of the products that used it 5-star reviews. Granted it being a smaller sample, which would lead me to wanting to perform more analysis as the number of adopters grow. 

Another test that I would conduct to determine more information would be factoring in verified purchases with the reviews in the vine program. To make sure that users are actually receiving the products they are reviewing and that the reviews are credible.
